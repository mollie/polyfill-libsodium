# Polyfill Libsodium

A simple Polyfill for giving libsodium compatibility when having sodium installed.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mollie/polyfill-libsodium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mollie/polyfill-libsodium)

The new sodium extension has been accepted and will be distributed with PHP >= 7.2.  
This will have a few breaking changes:

- No more `\Sodium\` namespace. Everything must be in the global namespace.
- The extension will be renamed to `sodium`. 
- `\Sodium\randombytes_buf()` and `\Sodium\randombytes_random16()` have been removed. 

So the current namespaced functions will not work anymore. So we created a polyfill for this.
